# Computer Science II
## Project - OOP

This is a project used in Computer Science II (CSCE 156) for Fall 2023 
in the [School of Computing](https://computing.unl.edu) 
at the [University of Nebraska-Lincoln](https://unl.edu).

## Overview

### Lab Objectives & Topics
Following the lab, you should be able to:
* use classes and objects to write Java programs
* understand Inheritance and design classes and subclasses in Java
* understand and use interfaces and abstract classes in Java
* understand polymorphism in Java


### Peer Programming Pair-Up

At the start of
each project, you may find a team member by yourself or may be randomly paired up with another student by
a lab instructor.  One of you will be designated the *driver* and the other the *navigator*. If you prefer to work on this project by yourself, that is fine too.  Each week you should try to alternate: if you were a driver last week, be a navigator next, etc. 


## 1. Getting Started

Clone this project code for this project from GitHub in Eclipse using the
URL: `https://github.com/lisongxu/CSCE156-Project-OOP`. 


## 2. Social Media Application - Jstgram


In this project, we will design and develop a simple social media application using Java, called *Jstgram*. It supports two basic features

* Account management: A user can create a new account and log into an existing account.  
* Post management: A user can create various types of posts and list the past posts.  


### 2.1 Main Window

When Jstgram starts, it should display the *Main Window* as shown below. This window is displayed by calling `Views.mainWindow()` in the provided `Views` class.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/main_win.png" alt="Main Window" width="30%"/>
</p>  

It reads the user input from the keyboard, and then goes to the *Account Registration Window* or the *Account Login Window*, or quits the application.

### 2.2 Account Registration Window

The *Account Registration Window* is demonstrated below. It asks the user for the account information, and you may creatively ask for more information, such as email and job. This window is displayed by calling `Views.accountRegistrationWindow()`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/user_registration_win.png" alt="User Registration Window" width="30%"/>
</p>  
 
After creating an account, Jstgram goes back to the *Main Window* so that a user can login or create other new accounts.


### 2.3 Account Login Window

The *Account Login Window* with successful login and failed login are demonstrated below. Jstgaram asks for the username and password, and then compares with the existing account information in `accounts`. This window is displayed by calling `Views.accountLoginWindow()`.


<p align="center">
<img src="images/login_win_succ.png" alt="Login" width="30%"/> 
<img src="images/login_win_failed.png" alt="Login" width="30%"/>
</p>  

If the typed username and password match with an existing account,  this account is the current account and Jstgram goes to the *Post View Window* for the account; otherwise, it goes to the *Main Window*. Note that, at any time, there is at most one current account. 


### 2.4 Post View Window

The *Post View Window* lists all the past posts (by all accounts) in the descending order of the time, and then asks the user to create a new post, logout the current account, or quit the application. Below shows a possible *Post View Window* with a total of 4 posts. This window is displayed by calling `Views.postViewWindow()`.


<p align="center">
<img src="images/post_view_win.png" alt="Post View" width="30%"/>
</p>  

After reading the user input, Jstgram 
* goes to the *New Post Window* to create a new post
* or logs out the current account and goes back to the *Main Window*
* or quits the application. 



### 2.5  New Post Window

The *New Post Window* is shown below, where a user can choose to create either a text post or a text art post. This window is displayed by calling `Views.newPostWindow()`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/new_post_win.png" alt="New Post" width="30%"/>
</p>  


Below is a demonstration where a user selects `T` and then types a text post.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/txt_post.png" alt="New txt Post" width="30%"/>
</p>  

Below is a demonstration where a user selects `A` and then chooses no 1 in the 4 predefined text art options. These text art options are defined as a `List<String[]>` constant `OPTIONS` in class `TextArtPost`. You are welcome to modify and add more text art options. The window of text art options is displayed by calling `Views.displayTextArtOptions()`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/textart_post.png" alt="New text art Post" width="30%"/>
</p>  


After creating a post, Jstgram goes back to the *Post View Window*.


  

## 3. Project Requirement


### 3.1 Classes

You are provided with the following fully completed classes
* the `Views` class
* the `Post` class
* the `PostContentFormatter` interface

You will write and complete the following partially complete classes
* the `Account` class
* the `TextPost` class
* the `TextArtPost` class
* the `Main` class, which is the class to run the application

You are free to define and write more methods and/or classes to handle account login, handle account registration, create new post, and list past posts.

### 3.2 Class Requirements

* The `Account` class must have 3 (or more) private data fields: `private String userName`, `private String password`, and `private String phoneNumber` and the corresponding public getter methods. 


* Both the `TextPost` and `TextArtPost` classes extend abstract class `Post` and implement interface `PostContentFormatter`. Their relation is shown in the following UML diagram ([Generated using PlantUML Plugin for Eclispse](https://github.com/cbourke/ComputerScienceII/blob/master/resources/uml.md)).
<p align="center">
<img src="images/post_uml.png" alt="UML of Post Classes" width="50%"/>
</p>  

* Both the `TextPost` and `TextArtPost` classes extend abstract class `Post`, because they use the same data fields, `postTime` and `postAccount`, defined in `Post`.
    * The `TextPost` class should have its own data field to store the text typed by a user.
    * The `TextArtPost` class should have its own data field to store the no of the text art chosen by a user. 


* Both the `TextPost` and `TextArtPost` classes implement interface `PostContentFormatter` to implement the `getFormattedContent()` method, which `Views.viewPost()` in the *Post View Window* calls to display each post in the approriate format. 


* Please use a `HashMap` variable `accounts` to keep track of all account information. For each key-value pair, 
the key is the account username, and the value is the corresponding account. For example, statement `accounts.put(userName, new Account(userName, password, phoneNumber))` adds a new account to `accounts`.


* Please use an `ArrayList<Post>` variable `postList` to store all the posts, which is the argument of method `Views.viewPost()`. 


## 4. Grading and Submitting Your Project
